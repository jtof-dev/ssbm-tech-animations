frame-by-frame tech and knockdown animations

- animations scraped from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/i7tx5c/tech_and_knockdown_options_for_the_top_7_plus/)

  - for now, I only scraped the side-by-side videos, though there are also individual vidoes for each animation

## todo

- [ ] make simple github pages site to view videos frame-by-frame
